				<p>2 Months after the war began, serbian troops and police raid many urban and rural areas in parts where ethnic albanians reside in the region of Kosovo. A secret liberation army, codenamed "UÇK", i creating a plan alongside NATO and american forces, in order to liberate all of Kosovo and banish all serbian troops from the albanian residences in Kosovo. A young man named Afrim, a tractor driver in his village, is recruited as a semi-spy, to investigate and uncover plans about the serbian plan to cleanse all albanians in Kosovo, where he, his childhood friend Rrahman and american soldier Michael, will try to bring peace to Kosovo once and for all.</p> 
				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Day 1: The Beginning</h2>
				<p>As any other day in his village, Afrim is woken up by the sounds of a rooster and the sounds of his mother calling for him. He gets up, gets dressed, eats and sets off to work in the fields. A few hours pass, Afrim is done with the field work and heads off home. When he arrives, his sister Lule, gives him a letter that came in today. He opens the letter and reads it. The letter is an invitation from Sergeant Terrance. In the letter, Sergeant Terrance is recruiting Afrim and his friend Rrahman to join the "UÇK". Included in the letter, is an address where to find the headquarters. Afrim decides to head there tomorrow with his friend Rrahman. After dinner has passed, Afrim decides to go to sleep. After 2 hours pass, Afrim is woken up by screams of little boy. Afrim gets outside and follows where the noise is coming from. When he arrives, he sees his little brothers best friend Kemajl crying in front of his house. Afrim goes to conform him and asks what happend. Kemajl responds with: "My whole family was killed.". Afrim takes him to his house to spend the night. That night was the first massacre of the village. Afrim trys to go to sleep, but struggles. In the end, Afrim goes to sleep.</p>
				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Day 2: The Recruitment</h2>
				<p>After the events of last night, Afrim wakes up with terror in his eyes. He gets up, eats breakfast and gets dressed. After breakfast, He rings up Rrahman and together they head off to meet at the headquarters. Along the way to the city, Afrim and Rrahman are stopped by serbian police. They get out of the car and are searched for weapons. Luckily, the police let Afrim and Rrahman go without any harm. They continue their way toward the city. They arrive at the city and they start looking around to find the building headquarters. They find the building, an bandoned hotel, where they get out of the car. They go inside of the building and are greeted by a dark room. They find a flashlight and they look around to find the light switch. Interestingly the lights work, and at the elevator they find a note. On the note it says:"Head to 2nd floor for recruitment, 3rd floor for equipment, 4th floor for training. -Srg. Terrance.". Afrim and Rrahman go to the second floor and are greeted by Srg. Terrance and Michael. A few hours of discussion pass, Afrim and Rrahman are recruited and head off home. Along the way, they are once again stopped by serbian police. Before them there was a man in his car who was also stopped by the police. The Man gets out of the car and the two police men start beating him up. Afrim and Rrahamn, scared of what might happen, decide to wait until the police men go away. Unfortunitely, the damage was already done. They go to check on the man, and what they see is horrifying. The Man's mouth is covered in blood, there's bruises on his neck, chest, and legs. He is unconcious and wont wake up. Afrim and Rrahman take the man to their car and quickly drive to the hospital. When they arrive, they grab the man and then hastly take them to a room. A few hours pass, and it is night time, just when they thought that he was done for, the man wakes up. He takes a quick glance and begins to cry. Afrim and Rrahman comfort him. The man, with tears in his eyes, thanks the boys for their acting. After a few minutes, the boys call the man's family. After this, they say good bye to the man, get in the car and go home. With a stressful night as this, Afrim and Rrahman go to sleep in peace.</p>
